# Options
:::info
The source code for this example can be found in [examples/options](https://github.com/HEP-SoC/SoCMake/tree/master/examples/options)
:::
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
export const cmakelists = require('!!raw-loader!../../../examples/options/CMakeLists.txt')?.default;

SoCMake allow to use options, a script can easily be adapted to fit in a different environnement or to test different tools or features depending on your needs. 
This allows to make generic and configurable script if you would like to share your work with others.

Let's try to create an example with several options, to demonstrate how to use them.

## CMakeLists.txt

We can for example create a file like the following `CMakeLists.txt` to try the different possibilities:

<CodeBlock language="verilog" title="CMakeLists.txt" showLineNumbers>{cmakelists}</CodeBlock>

:::warning
Not all the options are taken in account in the files, it's to show how to implement them and the different types available
:::

SoCMake API add 4 new functions for options, that can be of the following type **boolean**, **integer**, **enum** or **string**.

They are generally composed of the following arguments : 
 - **VARIABLE** name of the variable
 - **DESCRIPTION** short description for the variable
 - **DEFAULT** default value of the variable
 
If using `option_enum()`, an other argument, a list of strings is needed, between the description and the default value to give the possible values.

### Instructions

To run the example we need to create a build directory as always:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
```

Then when generating the Makefile, we can choose to precise our options, like it's generally done with cmake scripts:

```bash
cmake -DSIM_TYPE=GENERIC -DSIM_TRACE=ON ../
```

:::tip
the `help()` function, if used, will create a file called `help_options.txt` after the configuration. It can be useful if you want to look at the different option and their values without looking in the CMakeLists.txt file
