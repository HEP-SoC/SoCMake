### Description

This example shows how to do simulation using DPI with SoCMake. In this case, we will have a C++ function called in a System-Verilog testbench, using DPI-C.

## Example

### Directory structure

Lets take a look at the directory structure of the example first.

```raw
.
├── hello
│   ├── CMakeLists.txt
│   └── hello.cpp
├── CMakeLists.txt
└── tb.sv
```

We have a directory `hello/` that contains the `hello` c++ function, it as its own `CMakeLists.txt` to make it easier to reuse in a larger project.
:::tip
For a design this simple it is not really necessary to have a separate `CMakeLists.txt`, but it is a good practice anyways.
:::

### hello/hello.cpp

Simple function that takes an integer and return the integer + 10.

<CodeBlock language="cpp" title="hello/hello.cpp" showLineNumbers>{dpi_c}</CodeBlock>

### hello/CMakeLists.txt

The following `CMakeLists.txt` will create a library called `hello_dpi` and use the `target_link_libraries` function to declare it as a library with DPI.

<CodeBlock language="cmake" title="hello/CMakeLists.txt" showLineNumbers>{cmakelist_dpi_c}</CodeBlock>

### tb.sv

This is a standard System-Verilator testbench. The DPI-C is imported and called.

<CodeBlock language="verilog" title="tb.sv" showLineNumbers>{testbench}</CodeBlock>


### CMakeLists.txt

And finally we need a top `CMakeLists.txt` that will assemble the full project and create simulation targets.

<CodeBlock language="cmake" title="CMakeLists.txt" showLineNumbers>{cmakelists}</CodeBlock>

To give the right flags to use the DPI-C with the simulator used, the `${simulator}_configure_cxx()` function can be used, in our case, we will use `verilator_configure_cxx(LIBRAIRES DPI-C)`.

We can add the `adder` IP as a subdirectory with [`add_subdirectory()`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_subdirectory.html) CMake function.

Then, we can just use the SoCMake function corresponding to the simulator we want to use, in our case `verilator()`, with the `MAIN` argument, which will take care of generating the different needed files to run the simulation.

## Running the simulation

Simulation can be run the same way as always:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../ -DSIMULATOR=questa     # Configure project
make run_tb_verilator -j$(nproc) # Build and run testbench
```
